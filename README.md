# Sekou Dayifourou Keita AKA *Manager Dayif*

## Who I Am
I am a developer from Mali who treats software as both craft and strategy.  
Each project is more than code — it’s a calculated move, built to endure, designed to influence.  
I value precision, scalability, and purpose over trends and noise.  

## Current Focus
- **Sensei** — An e-learning platform reshaping how knowledge flows. Powered by **Spring Boot, Angular, Next.js**.  
- **Concept Lab** — My private ground for experiments, blending **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS** into bold prototypes.  

## Technical Arsenal
**Frontend**: React, Next.js, TypeScript  
**Backend**: Express.js, Node.js, PHP REST APIs  
**Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB  
**Workflow**: Git, GitHub, Tailwind CSS  

## Philosophy 
My aim is clarity over clutter, elegance over excess, and results over excuses.  
Every product I build is meant to solve, to inspire, and to last.  

## Beyond Code
- Student of history to sharpen foresight.  
- Strategic thinker — I see football like chess.  
- Innovator who chases the wave only to lead it.
